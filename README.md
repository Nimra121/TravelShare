# Theme: Travel & Local
# Implemented In: Android Studio

# Abstract / Summary
Travel Share is a mobile application where people can share with other people that they will be travelling on a specific date from one place to another place. And if anyone wants to send anything to their relatives, then it can be handed over to them and they can take the that to their destination i.e. other cities/countries, in return for some cash. The mainstream logistics companies are excessively expensive and time-consuming, because of their large-spread coverage but relatively less delivery employees. Practically it is also not feasible for a logistics company to send goods as soon as they receive them because eventually, they have to wait for the enough luggage to be received and then ship it. This appâ€™s purpose is to reduce the cost and the long time period which other logistic companies take for transporting luggage from one place to another. Through this app, senders and receivers can interact meaningfully, getting the job done in a more efficient and less time-consuming way. The target customers will be people who travel a lot i.e. tourists or people who have jobs, which require going from city to city or even other countries. Similarly, people who want to send anything to a distant place, especially who require it more often, will benefit from this app.
